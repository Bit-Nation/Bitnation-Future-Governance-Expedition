## The rapid shifts of recent years has created a new world. Yet we are running it on an old operating system.


Environmental challenges paired with technological disruption places humanity at a crossroads. We could be facing abundance or crisis. Both are highly likely - while continued status quo is increasingly unthinkable.

For the last five years, Bitnation has been gathering the most forward-looking applications of new technology for governance, in order to prepare the governance upgrade that the present fast-paced changes urgently call for.

In August Bitnation Future Governance Expedition launches, dedicated to systematise the fast-growing knowledge, mobilise the global community of governance innovators and explore – and create – the systems of tomorrow.


_"Having spent the last years at GCF, mapping governance innovation initiatives in over 180 countries, it’s become clear to me that the time is right to mobilise the wealth of ideas into common action across borders and institutions. The Bitnation Future Governance Expedition aims to systematise, synthesize, and prepare suggested upgrades to current governance, ranging from general aspects such as citizenship, automation, trust, and privacy – to the more detailed ins and outs of specific implementations."_
