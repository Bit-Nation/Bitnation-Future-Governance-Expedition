# Bitnation-Future-Governance-Expedition


## The rapid shifts of recent years has created a new world. Yet we are running it on an old operating system.


Environmental challenges paired with technological disruption places humanity at a crossroads. We could be facing abundance or crisis. Both are highly likely - while continued status quo is increasingly unthinkable.

For the last five years, Bitnation has been gathering the most forward-looking applications of new technology for governance, in order to prepare the governance upgrade that the present fast-paced changes urgently call for.

In August Bitnation Future Governance Expedition launches, dedicated to systematise the fast-growing knowledge, mobilise the global community of governance innovators and explore – and create – the systems of tomorrow.
